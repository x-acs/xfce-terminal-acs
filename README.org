** Installation
To install ACS on Xfce Terminal, follow these instructions:

1. Make sure that you've the ~colorschemes/~ directory inside your Xfce Terminal config path. If you do, skip this step. If you don't, don't worry, because for some reason it's not shipped with Xfce stuff anymore, but as we need it, create it by running:
   #+begin_src sh
   mkdir -p ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes
   #+end_src

2. Clone this repo and move the ~.theme~ files to the Xfce Terminal config path:
   #+begin_src sh
   git clone https://git.disroot.org/x-acs/xfce-terminal-acs.git

   cp -f xfce-terminal-acs/src/* ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/
   #+end_src

3. Select the chosen theme in the Xfce Terminal preferences dialog. To do that, open a Xfce Terminal instance, right click in a blank area, click in ~Preferences...~ button, click in ~Colors~ tab, go to ~Presets~ section, click in the ~Select Preset~ button to show a dropdown list with the installed themes and then finally select your desired ACS theme. Check the following screenshots to make sure what to do:
