** Installation
To install ACS on Xfce Terminal, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you have the ~colorschemes/~ directory inside your Xfce
   Terminal config path.

   If you don't have it, don't worry, because, for some reason, it's no longer
   shipped with Xfce stuff, so let's create it by running

   #+begin_src sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes
   #+end_src

2. Clone this repo and move the ~.theme~ files to the Xfce Terminal config path
   by running

   #+begin_src sh
git clone https://git.disroot.org/x-acs/xfce-terminal-acs.git

cp -f xfce-terminal-acs/src/* ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes/
   #+end_src

3. Select the chosen theme in the Xfce Terminal preferences dialog.

   To do that, open a Xfce Terminal instance, right click in a blank area and
   click in the ~Preferences...~ button, just like this:

   Now click in the ~Colors~ tab, go to the ~Presets~ section, click in the
   ~Select Preset~ button to show a dropdown menu with the installed themes and
   then finally select your desired ACS theme, like this:

Now it's done!
